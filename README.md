# Airline Reservation System Implementation
Basic Airline Reservation System Implementation via Binary Search Trees and Queues

Implementing a binary search tree data structure, in which each node will contain the data and two pointers to the root nodes of its left and right subtrees. The binary search tree data structure will include a single pointer that points to the root node of the binary search tree. The details of the structure are explained further in the More-Info.pdf section. This specialized binary search tree structure is used to implement an airline reservation system.
